# 3D Renderer

## Overview

This project is a 3D Renderer developed using OpenGL in C++, designed to provide an interactive environment for rendering and manipulating 3D models. The application utilizes ImGui for a user-friendly graphical interface and Assimp for importing a variety of 3D model formats. The goal is to create a versatile tool for visualizing 3D assets in real-time.
Features

- Real-Time Rendering: Efficient rendering of 3D graphics using OpenGL, supporting advanced techniques such as lighting, shading, and texture mapping
- Model Importing: Import and visualize 3D models in various formats (OBJ, FBX, GLTF, etc.) using Assimp.
- Interactive User Interface: Built with ImGui, the interface allows for easy interaction with the 3D scene, including model transformations and property adjustments.
- Camera Controls: Smooth camera navigation for exploring the 3D environment with zoom, pan, and rotation functionalities.
- Custom Shader Support: Ability to apply custom shaders for enhanced visual effects and rendering quality.

## Technologies Used

- C++: The primary programming language for implementing the renderer.
- OpenGL: Graphics API for rendering 3D graphics.
- ImGui: Immediate mode GUI library for creating the user interface.
- Assimp: Library for importing 3D model files in various formats.
